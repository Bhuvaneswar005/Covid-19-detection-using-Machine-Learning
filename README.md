Technological advancement has a profound effect
on all spheres of life, whether in the medical field or in any
other field. Artificial intelligence has shown promising results in
health care by making its decisions by analyzing and processing
data. To prevent the spread and development of a life-threatening
disease, the most important step is its early diagnosis. COVID-19
is a highly contagious disease, and has become a global epidemic
that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Due to its rapid
speed of spreading comes the need for a system which can be used
to detect the virus. With the increase in use of technology, lots
of data about COVID-19 is readily available at our fingertips,
which can be used to obtain important information about the
virus. In this project, we compared the accuracies of different
machine learning algorithms in predicting COVID-19 and used
the most accurate one in the final model testing.
