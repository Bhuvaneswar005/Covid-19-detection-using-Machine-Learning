# Covid-19-detection-using-Machine-Learning
Technological advancement has a profound effect
on all spheres of life, whether in the medical field or in any
other field. Artificial intelligence has shown promising results in
health care by making its decisions by analyzing and processing
data. To prevent the spread and development of a life-threatening
disease, the most important step is its early diagnosis. COVID-19
is a highly contagious disease, and has become a global epidemic
that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Due to its rapid
speed of spreading comes the need for a system which can be used
to detect the virus. With the increase in use of technology, lots
of data about COVID-19 is readily available at our fingertips,
which can be used to obtain important information about the
virus. In this project, we compared the accuracies of different
machine learning algorithms in predicting COVID-19 and used
the most accurate one in the final model testing.


In December 2019, the novel coronavirus appeared in the city of Wuhan in China [1] and was reported to the
World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019.
The virus posed a global threat and was named COVID-19
by the WHO on the 11th. February 2020. W.H.O declared
the outbreak a public health emergency [2] and stated the
following; “the virus is spread through the respiratory tract
when a healthy person comes in contact with an infected
person”. An infected person shows symptoms within 2-14
days. According to W.H.O the symptoms and signs of
moderate to severe conditions are dry cough, fatigue and
fever while in severe cases dyspnea, fever and fatigue may
occur. People with other illnesses such as asthma, diabetes,
and heart disease are at greater risk of contracting the virus
and may become seriously ill. A system which can be used
to detect the virus has become necessary due to the rapid
spread of the virus, killing hundreds of thousands of people.
Machine learning classification algorithms, data sets and
machine learning software are essential tools for designing
the COVID-19 predictive model.
This project aims to compare different machine learning
algorithms like K-nearest neighbors, Random forest and
Naive Bayes with respect to their accuracies and then use
the best one among them to develop a system which predicts
whether a person has COVID or not using the data provided
to the model.
